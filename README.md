## What is WAT?

WAT (Waiting and Testing) is an automated testing Plugin for the Godot Game Engine to help you test your code in a quick, comprehensive and isolated enviroment. It is compatiable with Godot 3.1 (and hopefully further). It is not compatiable with older versions of Godot due to its use of typed code.

## Why WAT when GUT exists?

First and foremost because it was a learning experience about testing in general for me.

Secondly because I wanted a testing tool that would act as if it were part of the editor itself instead of a scene that runs them. This
presents its own issues with the usage of tool but so far so good.

For those unfamiller with GUT, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut)

## How do I use WAT?

You can check out the WAT Guide on the [WAT Wiki](https://github.com/CodeDarigan/WAT/wiki)

## Who created WAT?

WAT was created by myself (if we ignore GUT as WAT's predecessor and all the people who put up with my frustrations in the Godot Community Discord). You can send me a message here, on twitter [@CodeDarigan](https://twitter.com/CodeDarigan) or on reddit [/u/CodeDariganIE](https://www.reddit.com/user/CodeDariganIE)
